A simple batch script that helps you bypass Windows 11's system requirements by applying some registry hacks.

You might be wondering "but, why?". Yeah, exactly.  
The reason I came up with this simple script is because I'm too lazy adding all those registries manually and I want to automate that process. (if it could be automated, why not? right?)  
The other main reason is that it's much safer to use these kinds of solution, rather than using a pre-patched ISO that you may never know what kinds of surprises you'll get from them.

# How to use
You should first have a little bit of knowledge on how to use the Command Prompt.
1. Place the script anywhere you'd like (but not on the drive you're going to install Windows on, coz you'll wipe out that drive)
2. On the installation screen, hit SHIFT + F10 to bring up the Command Prompt / CMD window.
3. Run the script from that cmd.

An example command:
~~~
D:/script_name.bat
~~~
As simple as that.
